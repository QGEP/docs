Digitizing Detailed Geometry as Drainage Channel
================================================

General
-------------------------

You can add a polygon to a wastewater structure just with drawing a simple line. The function creates a rectangle from the line with a width of 20cm. This is specially useful for manholes with function drainage channel. 

Digitizing tool
-------------------------

* Select the **vw_qgep_wastewater_structure** layer
* Use the **Identify features** tool on the object to which you want to add a drainage channel geometry
* Right click the object and select the **vw_qgep_wastewater_structure** layer
* Choose **Digitize Drainage Channel**
* You can now start digitizing: draw a simple line with two clicks. 
* The polygon is created in the **od_wastewater_structure** layer

An other way is to open the vw_qgep_wastewater_structure form with the info tool and then choose **Digitize Drainage Channel** in the **Actions** menu of the form.
