Adding or Editing of Maintenance Events
=========================================


This represents a guide on how to add or edit maintenance event data in QGEP.

General
-------

* Maintenance events can be connected to one structure or to many.
  Therefore QGEP uses a intermediary RE_table to model the n:m relationship (**re_maintenance_event_wastewater_structure**)


Adding a new Maintenance Event
-------------------------------------------------------------

* Enable the edit mode.
* With the **Identify Features** tool you can select **wastewater_structures** or **reaches** by selecting their corresponding layer (**vw_qgep_wastewater_structure** or **vw_qgep_reach**).
* The respective form will open. Change to the **Maintenance** tab.

* Create a new maintenance event with the **Add child feature** button.

 * Edit the new record in the vw_qgep_maintenance form, then click **OK**

Link an existing Maintenance Event
-------------------------------------------------------------

* Enable the edit mode.
* With the **Identify Features** tool you can select **wastewater_structures** or **reaches** by selecting their corresponding layer (**vw_qgep_wastewater_structure** or **vw_qgep_reach**).
* The respective form will open. Change to the **Maintenance** tab.

* Click the **Link existing child features** button.

 * Choose a maintenance event from the **Dialog** window by clicking in the box of the record. The box must by yellow. Then click **OK**

 * Close the windows with **OK** and turn of the edit mode to save changes


Unlink Maintenance Events
-------------------------------------------------------------

* Enable the edit mode.
* With the **Identify Features** tool you can select **wastewater_structures** or **reaches** by selecting their corresponding layer (**vw_qgep_wastewater_structure** or **vw_qgep_reach**).
* The respective form will open. Change to the **Maintenance** tab.

* Select a maintenance event by clicking in the box (box gets yellow), then click the **Delete child feature** button.

 .. attention:: There is only the record in the RE-table deleted. The maintenance event record himself is not deleted and can by linked with other wastewater structures.


Editing
--------

 * Do as described in adding - but just edit existing maintenance events. Or edit the **vw_qgep_maintenance** table (layer group **inspection**)


Multi Edit
-----------------------------------------------------------

There is in the moment no tool to create or to link a maintenance event to a selection of reaches or wastewater structures. If you open the form in multi edit mode, the **Maintenance** tab is empty.
Multi edit with linked tables is not implemented in QGIS.
