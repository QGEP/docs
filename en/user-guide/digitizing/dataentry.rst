Data entry
==========

There are basically two ways:

* Data entry by constructing or digitizing in the QGEP GIS itself
* Data entry in an external programm or software and then importing the position and/or technical data into QGEP e.g.:

   * coordinates from manholes from measurement
   * position and/or technical data from another GIS or CAD system
   * using data from the surveyor (e.g. property boundaries) as a basis for defining catchment borders
   * other

Data entry in QGEP needs some understanding of the underlaying data model VSA-DSS, but is supported with some great data collecting wizards and forms that link the different tables correctly together.
