.. _Extract-Results:

SWMM Extract Results
--------------------

If you don't want to store the results in QGEP, this function generates two QGIS tables from a report file. 
You can map the values with the geometries (see: :ref:`mapping-not-imported`).

Launch ``SWMM Extract results``:

- ``RPT file``: the ``.rpt`` file generated during the previous step
- ``Node summary``: a table layer which stores the simulation results.
- ``Link summary``: a table layer which stores the simulation results.
- ``Cross section summary``: a table layer which stores the simulation results.
